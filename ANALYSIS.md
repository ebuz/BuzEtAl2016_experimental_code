# Analysis framework for this experiment

## Standard analysis
The recordings here are to be tested using the conventions of Baese-Berk & Goldrick: extract VOT times of the targets and compare VOT changes across conditions.
Further, in line with prior work, we should look at _duration_ differences across condition.

## Post-hoc analysis for further work
Because the initial run will only contain onset+voicing neighbor competitors, it would be inappropriate to look at formant changes in the vowel, however, we can look at the recording quality and determine how likely it will be that we can do this for future experiments without additionally adding in qualifications for mturkers.

We are not able to control the screen display, however, we will be recording the experiment window dimensions in hopes that this will give us some traction on how it's being displayed across computers.
We should, first, make sure that there aren't any participants with either abnormally large or abnormaly small screens that will affect the stimuli presentation.
Second, we should determine what the average size of each stimulus was as well as their relative distance from each other.

We are really concerned about the feedback maniuplation as well as the cover story.
We need to determine if 1) it works and 2) if it doesn't work does it affect the results.
We should comb over the survey responses about this and further check for interactions between cover story believability and VOT differences.
