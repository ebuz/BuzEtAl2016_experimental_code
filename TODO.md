# General changes #
* Scrub the SocAlign1 references
* Import the changes made to SocAlign1 from the prior version of this

# Dealing with partner timings #
* Change the instructions such that it presents the pseudo-confederate setup
* Change the survey responses at the end to include debrief
* Add in a "waiting for partner" load screen
* Add a set of practice trials, presumably from a generated list
* Add the trial format: blank, preview, cue + timer, feedback
> * The cue + timer should run alone - that is, the experimental list will explicitly state pseudo-confederate response, accurate (yes/no) and time. If the trial timer runs out before response time then move on.
