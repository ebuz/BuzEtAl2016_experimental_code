# Experimental list versions
## sz_mp
### Design
This is a 2x2 (within and between) subject design of neighbor/no neighbor and either s-final or z-final targets.

### Stimuli
The stimuli are s and z final words that either have or do not have s/z minimal pairs.

46 or 56 total test trials.
6 practice trials are given before hand.

### List Count
There are 8 lists total, 4 for s and 4 for z, of those 2 for the latin square and the reverse of both of those.

### participants
We are aiming for 5 people per list, 40 people total.

## sz_context
### Design
This is a 2x2 (within and between) subject design of neighbor/no neighbor visually present and either s-final or z-final targets.

### Stimuli
The stimuli are s and z final words that have s/z minimal pairs.

57 total test trials.
6 practice trials are given before hand.

### List Count
There are 8 lists total, 4 for s and 4 for z, of those 2 for the latin square and the reverse of both of those.

### participants
We are aiming for 5 people per list, 40 people total.

## Rep1
### Design
This is a 2x3 design.
First contrast is neighbor present vs no-neighbor.
Second contrast is feedback. In condition NoFeedback the speaker is never given information about 'partner' accuracy. In condition PositiveOnly the speaker is only given positive feedbackâ€”at no time are they told their partner picked the wrong word.

In condition PositiveNegative the speaker is told their partner picked the neighbor three times within the first 10 neighbor present trials then only positive feedback after.

Partner reaction time is in the experiment and is faster as the experiment continues but is not maniuplated across conditions.

6 lists + 6 reversed-order lists for a total of 12 experimental lists.
This is a between subjects latin square design. Each subjects sees all items in on of the conditions.

### Stimuli
The stimuli are a subset of the voiced onset minimal pair stimuli from Kirov & Wilson.
36 items, 11 /k/ initial, 12 /p/ initial, 13 /t/ initial.
54 fillers.

90 total test trials.
6 practice trials are given before hand.

### List Count
There are 12 lists total.

## rep1 design changes
PositiveNegative feedback changes:
1. Have the second filler trial be wrong and the first, second and third neighbor trial.
1. Three more wrong trials placed among the final trials such that increasing distance between the last wrong trial is tied to trial number.

## Rep1_v2
Same design as above with the addition of the rep1 changes to the PositiveNegative.
Additionally the fillers have been changed, now there are no filler targets that start with a voiced or voiceless stop (/bdg/,/kpt/).
This latter change is due to the discovered issue that the targets have up to this point been biased towards voiceless targets.
Note: this change doesn't actually fix this, that will be addressed in other versions.
