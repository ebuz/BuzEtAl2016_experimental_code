# Worklog #
* 2/15/13 - Imported fresh version of SocAlign1 to modify
* 2/18/13 - Started to fix the presentation divs, the javascript has to be changed to handle trial advance
* 2/19/13 - First working mock up done, the todo is still relatively unchanged though
* 2/20/13 - After a rocky start, the survey has been partly fixed, updated TODO with new things to change
* 2/21/13 - Added feedback in no and simple types, fixed timing issues, got experiment to end if people wait too long inter-trial wise
* 2/22/13 - Fixed one feedback issue, managed to re-name everything, cleaned up some unneeded files, sorted out experiment length issues
* 2/22/13 - Fixed so many things that this experiment is almost ready to go, final issues to deal with are practice trials and if I am feeling like it a cohesive way to handle the various files that need to be changed as outlined in the TODO.md
* 2/24/13 - Added practice trial code and removed direct need for itemno variable except in a few spots. Will need to test all of this code but will need to generate some practice trials and shorter experiment lists to be sure everything else is working
* 2/25/13 - Did a prelim test, experiment moves through all the trials in a list, earlier tests of behavior on submit was good so this experiment should be close to production
* 2/26/13 - Pushing code to Andrew to see it served on www, still need to finalize the lists but that's OK
* 2/28/13 - Needed to add some timing variables during the code for later, also have to add in some more survey questions
* 2/11/13 - New branch to handle the few TODO items, named it and it should be folded back into the master branch when the code is finished and tested
* 2/14/13 - Started out to build the new timing codes, at the moment it only handles the practice and further it is not yet linked to the start experiment button nor does it correctly start the actual experimental trials
* 2/27/13 - Tested the practice code and got it working mostly, need to do some small timing changes.
* 2/28/13 - Ported the practice code over to the rest of the experiment, did some other small fixes
