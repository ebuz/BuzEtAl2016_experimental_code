            <h2>Picture Description</h2>
            <p>This experiment consists of three parts, followed by a short questionnaire.</p>
            <p>In the first part, you will listen to a short speech from an amateur debater.
            In this speech, the speaker will present his/her stance on a current political
            issue. Listen carefully to the speech, and form an impression of the speaker and
            their argument. You will be asked to describe them later.</p>
            <p>In the second part, you will be presented with ten pictures, one at a time.
            When each picture is displayed it will automatically start recording audio. Please describe what is
            happening in each picture using <span style="font-weight:bold;">one sentence</span>.
            Then press "Finish" to advance to the next picture.
            Also, please avoid pronouns (words like he/she, him/her, etc). For example,
            if the picture was of a boy smiling at a girl, you could say "The boy is smiling at the girl" but not
            "He is smiling at her."</p>
            <p>Part three is a brief survey. This survey consists of questions about the
            speech that you heard in part one and questions about you as a participant.
            The data we collect with the survey will be non-identifying. We will not share
            your information with any third parties (the human subject review board at the
            University of Rochester monitors that we follow these rules).</p>
            <p>All together the experiment will take about 20-25 minutes. </p>
            <p>Please do not take breaks in the middle of the experiment. It is
            important that you do the experiment in one go.</p>
