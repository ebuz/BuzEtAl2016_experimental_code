            <h2>Picture Description</h2>
            <p>This experiment consists of three parts, followed by a short questionnaire.</p>
            <p>In the first part, you will listen to 25 sentences. After each sentence, you will need
            to press the play button on the screen to advance to the next sentence. Pay careful
            attention to the sentences, as you will be asked questions about them later.</p>
            <p>In the second part, you will be presented with ten pictures, one at a time.
            There will be a textbox provided with each picture. Please describe what is
            happening in each picture using <span style="font-weight:bold;">one sentence</span>. Also, please avoid pronouns
            (words like he/she, him/her, etc). For example, if the picture was of a boy
            smiling at a girl, you could say "The boy is smiling at the girl" but not
            "He is smiling at her."</p>
            <p>Part three will contain questions about the sentences in the first part.</p>
            <p>Following the experiment, there will be a short survey (2 minutes or less).
            Taking this survey is optional, but please consider that your answers would be
            extremely helpful for the scientific interpretation of the data we will obtain
            from you. The survey will ask you both about some basic aspects of your daily
            life and about your experience doing this experiment. The data we collect with
            the survey will be non-identifying. We will not share your information with any
            third parties (the human subject review board at the University of Rochester
            monitors that we follow these rules). All together the experiment will take
            about 15-20 minutes.</p>
            <p>Please do not take breaks in the middle of the experiment. It is
            important that you do the experiment in one go.</p>
